# Why Cloud?

Only pay for what you use. Helps lower operating cost and help run infrastructure in a more efficient manner and help the business to scale out.

# Cloud Provider

Azure, AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Ali Cloud

# Services

Compute Power

Storage

Networking

Analytics

# Key Terms/ Concepts

-   High Availability

    Keep Services Running & Minimal Downtime

-   Scalability

    -   Increase/ Decrease Resources for Workloads
    -   Scale out: Add more resources to spread out the workload.
    -   Scale up: Make existing resources faster or bigger so it can handle more workloads.
    -   Does not have to be done automatically.

-   Elasticity

    Automatically Increase / Decrease Resources

-   Agility

    -   Ability to react quickly.
    -   Result to vast amount of resources that can be provisioned.
    -   No manual intervention necessary.

-   Fault Tolerance

    -   Remain running despite service failure.
    -   Built-in redundancy.(Back Up Component)

-   Disaster Recovery

    Recovery from events that take down a cloud service.

-   Global Reach

    -   Reach users all over the world.
    -   Cloud services allow presence without physical footprint.

-   Customer Latency Capabilities

    -   Cloud services allow organizations to locate apps closer to end users, minimizing latency.

-   Predictive Cost Consideration

    -   Tools like cost calculators make it possible to make accurate cost estimates.

-   Tech skills

    -   Cloud providers manage underlying hardware.

    -   Allows organizations to quickly deploy solutions without in-house hardware expertise.

-   Increase Productivity

    -   No need to rack & stack hardware
    -   No need to manage patching.

-   Security

    -   Cloud providers offer security policies, technologies, controls, and skill sets.

    -   Results in improved security.

-   Economies of Scale

    -   The ability to reduce costs while improving efficiency as a result of operating at a larger scale versus operating at a smaller scale.

    -   Because cloud providers are very large business, they can leverage the benefits of economies of scale. In turn, they can pass on these benefits to customers.

## CapEx vs OpEx

-   Capital Expenditure

    -   Upfront expenditures on physical infrastructure
    -   Expenses are then deducted come tax time
    -   High upfront costs while value of the investment reduces over time

-   Operational Expenditure

    -   Purchase products or services as-needed
    -   Billed immediately
    -   Expenses deducted from tax bill in the same year
    -   No upfront costs pay-as-you use
    -   pay as much as can afford

## Consumption-Based Model

-   Incurs no up-front costs.
-   Costly infrastructure not needed
-   Pay for additional resources as-needed
-   Stop paying for resources that are no longer needed

# Cloud Models

## Public Cloud

Platform & Services owned by provider

REsources & Services provided to multiple organizations.

Typically accessed securely over internet.

-   Resources do not belong to the organization that is utilizing them, but rather they are owned and operated by a third party such as the cloud service provider.

-   Public cloud models may make their resources available to multiple organizations.

-   The most common cloud-type deployment model.

-   Organizations are typically connected to the public cloud over the internet using a web browser.

-   Public clouds do not require deep technical knowledge to set up and use its resources.

## Public Cloud Use Case

A common use case scenario for Public Cloud is an organization deploying a web app on hardware and resources that are owned by a cloud provider such as Microsoft Azure or AWS.

Leveraging public cloud in this case allows the organization to deploy its app quickly, without worrying about purchasing, managing or maintaining the hardware on which it runs.

## Private Cloud

Owned and operated by the organization that uses the cloud resources.

Each organization creates its own cloud environment in its data center.

Organization provides self-services access to compute resources to its user base.

Organization is responsible for maintaining and operating the service it provides.

-   The owner of the cloud and the user of the cloud are one in the same.

-   Owner is responsible for all Hardware purchases, management, and maintenance

-   Computing resources are not shared with other organizations.

-   Connections to a private cloud are typically made over private networks.

-   Private clouds are not generally made publicly accessible.

-   Deep technical knowledge needed in-house to setup, manage, and maintain.

## Private Cloud Use Case

A typical use case scenario for a private cloud is an organization that uses data that cannot be put in the public cloud for legal reasons. An example would be medical data that cannot be exposed publicly.

Another use case would be an organization that uses data that government policy requires to be kept in-country.

## Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud combines both Public and Private Clouds in order to run applications where most appropriate.

-   Some resources run in the public cloud while others runs in the private cloud.

-   Allows organizations to realize some benefits of a public model.

-   Organization retains management controls of private cloud only.

-   Tech skills are necessary to maintain the private cloud.

## Hybrid Cloud Use Case

An example of a hybrid cloud usage scenario would be an e-commerce site that's hosted in the public cloud while connecting back to a secure database hosted in a private cloud.

Hybrid cloud scenarios can be useful when organizations have some things that cannot be put in a public cloud, for legal or other reasons.

# Comparing Cloud Models

## Public Cloud Advantages

-   No capital expenditures
-   Increased agility
-   Pay-per-use model is typical /OpEx model
-   No maintenance requirements
-   Fewer in-house skills are necessary

## Public Cloud Disadvantages

-   Less control over security / unmet security requirements
-   Unmet compliance requirements
-   Lack of ownership can be seen as a disadvantage by some organizations

## Private Cloud Advantages

-   Control retained by the organization
-   Security controlled by the organization
-   Compliance managed by the organization

## Private Cloud Disadvantages

-   Upfront CapEx Costs
-   Less Agile
-   Maintenance and skill sets necessary

## Hybrid Cloud Advantages

-   Flexible Solution
-   Cost Management (Example: Use Cheaper Storage from Public Cloud)
-   Security & Control
-   Compliance

## Hybrid Cloud Disadvantages

-   Upfront CapEx
-   Maintenance and skill sets necessary
-   Management Complexity
