# Azure Solutions

## IoT Internet of Things

The ability to use devices to collect data and then to relay that data to a hub for further analysis.

## Azure IoT Central

a fully-managed global IoT SaaS solution that makes it easy to connect, monitor, and manage your IoT assets at scale. (no cloud expertise necessary)

## Azure Iot Hub

a managed service hosted in Azure that acts as a centra message hub for bidirectional communication between IoT applications & services.

Support "device-to-cloud" and "cloud-to-service"

Files upload from devices.
Devices-to-cloud telemetry.
request-reply.

IoT Hub monitoring helps organizations maintain the health of their IoT solutions by allowing them to track events like devices creation, device failures, and device connections.

## Big Data and Analytics

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse

a cloud-based Enterprise Data Warehouse that leverages massively parallel processing to run complex queries quickly across petabytes of data.

Analysis queries that take days to complete on a traditional database system typically complete within hours when run in SQL Data warehouse.

## Azure HDInsight

an open-source analytics services for enterprises that makes it easier to process massive amounts of data.

Azure HDInsights supports popular open-source frameworks and cluster types.Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop.

## Azure Data Lake Analytics

an on-demand analytics job service.

provides a cloud-based environment used to develop, train, test, deploy, manage, and track machine learning models.

## Azure Machine Learning Studio

a collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where your can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions without needing to write code.

less control than machine learning service

## Serverless Computing

an environment hosted in the cloud that allows you to run code.

## Azure Function
